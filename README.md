# Musik
A discord music bot that will recommend music and give a random daily song.

Production TODO:
- change OAuth flow to allow access for refresh token / deal with expiration of access token for spotify API
- create a better way of selecting which channel to use as the bots daily channel
  - command that can set a certain cahnnel to the new channel for these daily messages
- ensure slash commands work as stated / fix permissions when sending an invite link
